## Tools you need
Have a stackoverflow account : https://stackoverflow.com/

Have a github account : https://github.com/

### A Scala IDE :
1. Install the IDE "Intellij Idea": https://www.jetbrains.com/fr-fr/idea/download
2. [Fork this repo](https://docs.github.com/fr/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) to have your own copy.
3. Clone your fork on your machine
4. Open Intellij, go to "File" then "Open" and then only select the folder of the current exercice from your fork clone on your computer. Then, on IntelliJ [set up the scala SDK and JDK](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html)

**Beware** : For Spark code, we have to use **Java 17** (JDK17) or inferior, otherwise you'll have [this error](https://stackoverflow.com/a/73349341/3535853) :
